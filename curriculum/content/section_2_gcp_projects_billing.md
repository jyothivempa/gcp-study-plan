# Day 2: GCP Projects, Billing & Free Tier

**Duration:** ⏱️ 45 Minutes  
**Level:** Absolute Beginner  
**ACE Exam Weight:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very High (Projects & Billing appear across the exam)

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 2, learners will be able to:

*   **Explain** what a GCP Project is and why it is required.
*   **Understand** how billing accounts work in Google Cloud.
*   **Use** the GCP Free Tier safely.
*   **Apply** cost-control best practices to avoid surprise bills.
*   **Create** a project and set budgets & alerts correctly.

---

## 🧠 1. What Is a GCP Project? (Plain-English)

**A GCP Project is a logical container that holds all your cloud resources.**

Everything you create in Google Cloud *must* belong to a project:

*   🖥️ **Virtual Machines** (Compute)
*   💾 **Storage Buckets** (Data)
*   🌐 **Networks** (Connectivity)
*   🔐 **IAM Permissions** (Access Control)

👉 **Rule:** No Project = No Resources.

## 🌍 2. Real-World Analogy: The Office File Cabinet 🗄️

*   **Company** → Google Cloud Account (The Organization).
*   **File Cabinet** → **GCP Project** (Holds related stuff).
*   **Files/Folders** → **Resources** (VMs, Buckets, Databases).

### Why do we use projects?
1.  **Isolation:** Separate "Dev", "Test", and "Prod" environments completely.
2.  **Cost Tracking:** See exactly how much "Project A" costs vs "Project B".
3.  **Access Control:** Give a developer access to "Dev" but not "Prod".

> **🎯 ACE Tip:** If a question mentions "isolation", "billing separation", or "distinct environments" → The answer is almost always **Projects**.

## 🏗️ 3. GCP Resource Hierarchy (Simplified)

Think of it like a folder structure on your computer:

1.  **Google Account** (You)
2.  └── **Billing Account** (Your Credit Card)
3.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── **Project** (The Container)
4.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── **Compute Engine**
5.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── **Cloud Storage**
6.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── **IAM & Admin**

### Key Rules to Remember:
*   A Project can have only **ONE** Billing Account.
*   A Billing Account can pay for **MULTIPLE** Projects.

---

## 💳 4. Understanding Cloud Billing

GCP uses a **Pay-As-You-Go** model.

### How You Are Charged
*   **Usage:** How much CPU/RAM you use.
*   **Time:** How long a resource runs (per second).
*   **Region:** Some regions (e.g., Zurich) are more expensive than others (e.g., Iowa).

### The Billing Account 💼
*   Holds your payment method (Credit Card / Bank Account).
*   Pays for all linked projects.
*   Can be **disabled** to stop all spending (and stop all resources).

> **🎯 Exam Shortcut:** No active Billing Account = Paid resources **cannot** run.

---

## 🆓 5. GCP Free Tier (Safe Learning Zone)

Google gives you two ways to learn for free:

### 1️⃣ Always Free (No Expiry)
Resources you can use *every month* without paying:
*   **e2-micro VM:** 1 instance (US regions).
*   **Cloud Storage:** 5 GB Standard Storage.
*   **Cloud Functions:** 2 million invocations.

### 2️⃣ Free Trial Credits ($300)
*   **Amount:** $300 USD (or local equivalent).
*   **Validity:** 90 Days.
*   **Usage:** Can be used on almost any GCP service.

> **⚠️ Warning:** The Free Tier is **limited**. If you start a massive 64-core server, you *will* burn through your credits instantly.

## 🚨 6. Cost Control Rules (Critically Important)

Follow these rules to avoid "Cloud Shock" bills:

1.  ✅ **Stop/Delete Unused Resources:** Don't leave VMs running overnight unless needed.
2.  ✅ **Use Small Instances:** Stick to `e2-micro` or `e2-small` for practice.
3.  ✅ **Create Budgets:** Always set a budget to get warned *before* you overspend.
4.  ✅ **Clean Up:** Delete projects when you are done with them.

> **🎯 ACE Exam Tip:** If a question asks *"How to avoid unexpected charges?"* → The answer is **Budgets & Alerts**.

## 🛠️ 7. Hands-On Lab: Create a Project & Enable Billing

**🧪 Lab Objective:** Create your first GCP project and set up a budget to stay safe.

### ✅ Part 1: Create a Project
1.  **Open** the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
2.  **Click** the **Project Selector** dropdown (top bar, next to the Google Cloud logo).
3.  **Click** **"New Project"**.
4.  **Project Name:** Enter `gcp-learning-day2`.
5.  **Billing Account:** Ensure your active account is selected.
6.  **Click** **Create**. (Wait ~30 seconds).

### ✅ Part 2: Verify Billing Link
1.  **Search** for "Billing" in the top search bar.
2.  **Select** "Billing" from the results.
3.  **Verify** that `gcp-learning-day2` appears in the list of "Projects linked to this billing account".

### ✅ Part 3: Set a Budget (Best Practice)
1.  In the Billing section, click **"Budgets & alerts"** (left menu).
2.  Click **"Create Budget"**.
3.  **Name:** `Monthly-Safety-Budget`.
4.  **Amount:** Set to `Target amount: ₹500` (or $10 USD).
5.  **Actions:** Keep default alerts (50%, 90%, 100%).
6.  **Click** **Finish**.

> **🎉 Success!** You typically receive an email alert if your spend usually hits 50% of this amount. You are now safer to experiment!

## ⚠️ 8. Common Exam Traps

Don't fall for these common misconceptions on the ACE exam:

*   ❌ **Trap:** "Stopping a VM stops all costs."
    *   **Truth:** You still pay for the **Disk (Storage)** attached to it!
*   ❌ **Trap:** "Data transfer is free."
    *   **Truth:** Data coming **IN** (Ingress) is usually free. Data going **OUT** (Egress) usually costs money.
*   ❌ **Trap:** "Deleting a VM deletes the Project."
    *   **Truth:** No. The Project remains. To delete everything, delete the **Project**.
