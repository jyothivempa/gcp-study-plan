# SECTION 30: Final Exam Readiness (The Game Plan)

## 🏁 The Final Stretch
You have completed 29 Days of intense study.
You built VPCs, deployed Kubernetes clusters, optimized BigQuery tables, and secured IAM policies.
You are ready.

## 1️⃣ The "Golden Rule" of GCP Exams 🏆
Google Exams are not about memorizing commands. They are about **Business Constraints**.
*   *Question:* "You need to store data..."
*   *Constraint:* "...and retrieve it with sub-millisecond latency." -> **Redis/Memcache**.
*   *Constraint:* "...and query it using SQL." -> **Cloud SQL / Spanner**.
*   *Constraint:* "...and store it cheaply for 7 years." -> **Archive Storage**.

**Always look for the constraint. The constraint dictates the answer.**

## 2️⃣ Top 10 "Must Know" Topics
If you are 24 hours away from the exam, review these:
1.  **IAM:** Identity vs Role vs Policy. Service Accounts (Keys vs Attached).
2.  **VPC:** Subnets are Regional. VPCs are Global.
3.  **Compute:** Compute Engine vs App Engine vs Cloud Run vs Functions. (Know the "Use Case" table).
4.  **Storage:** Standard vs Nearline vs Coldline vs Archive.
5.  **Databases:** SQL (Relational) vs Spanner (Global) vs Bigtable (IoT/NoSQL) vs BigQuery (Analytics).
6.  **Load Balancing:** HTTP(S) (Global) vs Network (Regional Passthrough).
7.  **Interconnect:** VPN (Cheap/Easy) vs Interconnect (Fast/Dedicated) vs Peering.
8.  **GKE:** Autopilot vs Standard.
9.  **Ops:** Logging vs Monitoring vs Trace.
10. **Billing:** BigQuery slots, Committed Use Discounts, Sustained Use Discounts.

## 3️⃣ Exam Day Strategy 🧠
1.  **The "50/50" Rule:** Usually 2 answers are obviously wrong. Identify them immediately to double your odds.
2.  **Mark for Review:** If you stare at a question for > 60 seconds, **Mark it and move on**. Your brain will work on it in the background.
3.  **Read the "Why":** In the question "Why did they choose App Engine?", usually the *why* eliminates 3 options.

## 4️⃣ You Are Ready
Take a deep breath.
You didn't just read about the cloud. You **built** it.
