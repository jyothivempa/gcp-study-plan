# SECTION 22: The 30-Day Final Mock Exam

## 🧠 Exam Day Strategy
1.  **Read the End First:** Read the last sentence of the question. What are they asking? "Minimize cost?" "High Availability?" "Lowest Latency?"
2.  **Eliminate 2 Answers:** Usually 2 answers are obviously wrong (e.g., using a Regional service for a Global requirement).
3.  **Choose the "Google" Way:** If one option uses a Managed Service (Cloud SQL) and another uses a DIY approach (MySQL on VM), the Managed Service is almost always the answer.
